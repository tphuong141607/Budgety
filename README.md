# yesCode-Budgety (created on 8/2019)

During the process of learning "The Complete JavaScript Course 2019: Build Real Projects!", taught by Jonas Schmedtmann, I created the Budgety web app using ES5, basic HTML and CSS3. The users can add any income or expense, delete the current records, check the balance, check the percentage of both income and expense to better control their budget spending. 

The efficient and clean DOM manipulation technique and the project's workflow management are the major takeaway after completing building the Budgety app.
